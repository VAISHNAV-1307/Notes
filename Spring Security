Spring Security is all about application level security
It is distributed in two levels 1. Authentication , 2. Authorization
1. Authentication -> Authentication is the logic in the application which will figure out who is the user which is trying to access the application and
   is he allowed to access the application.
2. Authorization -> Authorization is providing access to particular things or functions based on authority or roles

In the micro services we secure the api endpoints

How to provide credentials
- To know how to provide credentials we should know, which type of authentication is getting used by application
- By default it uses HTTP basic type of authentication
- In case of HTTP basic we need to send the authentication credentials in the HTTP headers which will be base64 encoded
- In the postman we can directly have the option to navigate to authorization tab and select the option of Basic Auth and then provide the credentials
- By default user will always be user and when we did not done any configuration for the password the password will be self generated password by the spring security

How does it work ->
