Spring Security is all about application level security
It is distributed in two levels 1. Authentication , 2. Authorization
1. Authentication -> Authentication is the logic in the application which will figure out who is the user which is trying to access the application and
   is he allowed to access the application.
2. Authorization -> Authorization is providing access to particular things or functions based on authority or roles
