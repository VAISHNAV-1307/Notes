
Currently, I’m working on the ERM Portal Application at Data Economy. It’s an enterprise-level risk management platform that hosts over 10 integrated applications—called pillars—under a single portal with entitlement-based access control.
My main contribution has been on the Admin Module, where I worked on several critical features:
Dashboard Configurator: Enables admins to create and manage dashboards based on user SOEID or roles.
Dynamic Navigation: Built logic to show or hide menu items based on user entitlements.
Entitlement Reports: Created functionality to generate Excel reports for audit and compliance teams.
User Feedback Module: Designed a system to collect, store, and export user feedback data.
Delegation Feature: Developed a secure method for users to temporarily delegate their access to others.
Profile and Access Summary: Added a profile section that displays user details and entitlement info for transparency.
On the technical side, we used:
Java 11 and Spring Boot for backend services
Spring JPA and RESTful APIs for data access and communication
Oracle and MySQL databases
JUnit and Mockito for unit testing
Swagger and Postman for API testing and documentation
Bitbucket, Git, Jenkins, OpenShift, and Harness for version control, CI/CD, and deployment
Agile methodology for development process
This project helped me gain strong experience in building scalable, secure, and user-centric enterprise applications.
