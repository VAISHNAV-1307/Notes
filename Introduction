
Hi, I’m Vaishnav Abanave, a Software Engineer with 3 years of hands-on experience in building and maintaining enterprise-grade web applications.
I specialize in backend development using Java, Spring Boot, and RESTful APIs. I’ve worked extensively with tools like JPA for data persistence, Oracle and MySQL for databases, and used testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito to ensure high code quality.
In my current role at Data Economy, I’ve been part of the ERM Portal project, where I contributed to features like dynamic dashboards, entitlement-based navigation, and delegation workflows. We follow Agile methodology and use technologies like Git, Bitbucket, Jenkins, OpenShift, Swagger, and Postman as part of our CI/CD and API ecosystem.
