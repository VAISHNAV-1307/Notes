    4 pillers of Dom -
        1. selection of html element
            - document.querySelector("name of element") -> to select an html element
              for id use # in front fo element name
              for class use . in front fo element name
        2. changing html
            - select element first
              a.innerHtml - you can access inner things
        3. changing css
            - a.style.propertyOfCss - you can access css things
              write property in camelCase
        4. eventListner
            - listen any event happened in Dom
            - event is always predefined like click
            - we have to add event listener using addEventListner method and then we have to provide two input arguments to addEventListner
            - one is which event we want to access and what will happen after that event is occur means one callBack function
            
    Async and sync javaScript -
        Async -> start everything at a time
        main motive - when we dont know how much time we will need to get respnce at that time we use asyn so whenever answer will come at that time
        proceed for perticular code
        we are writing asyn when we are using fetching , axios , setTimeInterval or setTimeOut
        Sync -> start tasks after privious one is done , wait until first or privious is done
